# Stellaris Calculator

Stellaris is a complicated game. I started work on this project to model
aspects of the game so I could make meaningful decisions about my playthroughs.
(Some people make spreadsheets. I make programs.)

This project is not in a useful state yet and currently uses information from
version 3.4.5.
